        <h1>Introduction Of Human Viruses</h1>
        <br>
        <p>A virus can be simply defined as an obligate intracellular parasite. Each viral particle, or virion, consists of a single nucleic acid, RNA or DNA, encoding the viral genome surrounded by a protein coat, and is capable of replication only within the living cells of bacteria, animals or plants. <br><br>Structure: A typical virus consists of a protective protein coat, known as a capsid. The capsid shape varies from simple helical and icosahedra forms to more complex structures with tails. The capsid provides protection for the viral genome against the environment and functions in receptor recognition, targeting the virus to a susceptible host and cell type.</p>
